<p>My Role: User Analysis, Technical Research.
<p>Summary:  To find technological systems to provide more access and increase engagement for user at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

<p>OBJECTIVE<br>
Lack of uniformity among the existing interactive elements in terms of physical placement and implementation were causing confusion. The project was to identify and create an accessible interface for the regular audio guide through user research and testing.

Concept: Rent or Use Your Smartphone

<p>To access the Audio Guide web app with your Internet-enabled mobile device. User may also navigate to it from the homepage of our mobile website, or by selecting the Audio Guide option on select object pages on the mobile website.




GOAL

<p>Our goal is to help the user to experience the museum with a better navigation system.
<p><strong>How do visitors use tools like the audio guide?<br>
Can we increase take-up rate?</strong>
<p>“Increased visitor engagement” is the traditional and most common goal of mobile technology programs, but “marketing and word of mouth” and “reaching a wider audience” also ranked highly. Museums see broader potential in today’s mobile technology than just learning. The ease of two-way mobile interaction is also driving emerging goals, such as mobile giving/donation.

<p>We tackled the research questions through several paths:

<ul>
<li>We consulted users from other organisations who worked with audio and multimedia guides.
<li>We conducted surveys and short interviews with visitors.
<li>We performed several rounds of structured observations of audio-guide users, pausing after each round to analyse, discuss findings, and refine our categories.
<li>We developed personas that informed the design of a  prototype and tested it with visitors.

Problem

<p>Not enough people were using the audio guide.

<ul>
<li>Audio guide fees are person per day (other places offered guides for free)
<li>It wasn't an interactive platform
<li>The audio guide had a complicated navigation system
<li>There was a separate line you had to wait in to rent the audio guide

Solution

<p>Based on the user research we concluded that a mobile web app is an interactive solution that fits the needs of the Met Audio Guide.

<p>Smartphone apps will experience the fastest growth in 2011, followed closely by cell phone-guided audio tours. We also expect rapid growth in mobile.

The Met's Audio Guide, Now Available on Your Phone

<p>Today we've launched the public beta version of our new Audio Guide web app. For the first time, visitors can access our 2,601 audio stops, totaling over sixty hours of content in ten languages, from any web-enabled mobile device, be it iOS (Apple), Android, Windows, or Blackberry.
You can access the Audio Guide web app in one of three ways:

<ul>
  <li>1. In your mobile browser, by navigating straight to <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/audioguide" target="_blank">www.metmuseum.org/audioguide</a>
  <li>2. On the homepage of our mobile website
  <li>3. By selecting the Audio Guide option on select object pages on the mobile website
</ul>
</p>

<p>The Audio Guide web app is a significant step toward making our exceptionally rich catalogue of audio content about the collection more easily accessible. Already, over a quarter of a million visitors rent an Audio Guide each year. We know, though, that many visitors would prefer to use their own smartphones to access the Audio Guide than to rent a device. By developing an additional (free) web app version of the Audio Guide, we've now made this possible.
