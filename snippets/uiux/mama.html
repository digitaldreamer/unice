User Research

<p>What is the reason that women tried to lose weight and failed?</p>

<ul>
<li>Reason #1: Underestimating calories is not an issue when you don’t have to count them at all.</li>
<li>Reason #2: For weight loss, diet counts more than exercise. If you are not counting.calories for food, then do not sweat over how many calories you burn during a workout.</li>
<li>Reason #3: If you don’t want to eat, then don’t. But don’t binge either.</li>
</ul>
