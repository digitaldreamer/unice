CONCEPT

<p>Interface BIBIM developed from the idea of ‘Bibim bop,’ the Korean dish that mixes ingredients together, a tool that receives live feed and visualizes from the audience’s movement and the musician’s sound.
<p>Bibim is a highly responsive performance system enabling audience members to create visuals in real-time. All Together Now!
